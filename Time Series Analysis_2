#ARIMA

#Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average which is also know as 
#Box-Jenkins models which may include autoregressive, moving 
#average and differencing.

#It is referred as AR if it uses only autoregressive model, 
#MA if it uses Moving average. Differencing order refers to 
#successive first difference.

# It is used for forecasting trend and assumes that data are 
#correlated with the past data values

#p: Autoregressive Order
#d: Integration Order
#q: Moving Average Order

# Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) 
#used to estimate the parameters of ARIMA(p,d,q)

# Significance of Coefficients
#We can improve the model based on the confidence interval by looking 
#at the significant levels of co-efficient. Confidence interval of 
#the ARIMA model is computed by using confint() function.
confint(fit)
#it is not necessary that all of the 3 coefficients remain significant
# if any of the coefficient values changes its sign from positive to 
#negative or vice-versa, it implies that the value crosses the zero mark.
#Then the coefficients are considered to be insignificant.
